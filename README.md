# FTIR-Peak-Area-Sofware
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a technique commonly used to gain an insight into the chemical composition of materials. 
FTIR is particularily useful in analyzing asphalt binder (bitumen) due to the relative speed and ease of the measurement. 
FTIR makes it easy to collect large quantities of data very quickly. 
The collected data can later be used to train machine learning algorithms. 
However, the data for each sample needs to be first organized. 
One way of organizing data is deriving peak areas for commonly occuring peaks in the data.
This software allows batch processing of raw FTIR data to obtain peak areas for selected peak. 
The software further organizes the data for multiple samples into a single table saved as a CSV file.
